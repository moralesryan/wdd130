        <p> Hi! My name is Ryan Morales. I am a BYU Pathway Student,
            and I am studying Software Development and I am loving it!
            I love to paint, watch anime, and spend time with my family. I look forward to
            learning more about web development and creating awesome websites to help and inspire others and
            make a positive impact in the world. I love Jesus Christ, my family and this Gospel!
            They are my why!

        <p> Hi! My name is Ryan Morales. I am a BYU Pathway Student,
            and I am studying Software Development and I am loving it!
            I love to paint, watch anime, and spend time with my family. I look forward to
            learning more about web development and creating awesome websites to help and inspire others and
            make a positive impact in the world. I love Jesus Christ, my family and this Gospel!
            They are my why!

        <p>Costa Rica is a small country in Central America. It has lots of
            cool places to visit, one of my favorites is Playa Grande, on the East Coast.
            I don't go there very often, but when I do, I feel a strong connection to God and His
            wonderful creations.
